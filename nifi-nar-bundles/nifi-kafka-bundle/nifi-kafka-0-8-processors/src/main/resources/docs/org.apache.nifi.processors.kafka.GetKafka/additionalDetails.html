        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This Processors polls <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>
            for data. When a message is received from Kafka, this Processor emits a FlowFile
            where the content of the FlowFile is the value of the Kafka message. If the
            message has a key associated with it, an attribute named <code>kafka.key</code>
            will be added to the FlowFile, with the value being the UTF-8 Encoded value
            of the Message's Key.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kafka supports the notion of a Consumer Group when pulling messages in order to
            provide scalability while still offering a publish-subscribe interface. Each
            Consumer Group must have a unique identifier. The Consumer Group identifier that
            is used by NiFi is the UUID of the Processor. This means that all of the nodes
            within a cluster will use the same Consumer Group Identifier so that they do
            not receive duplicate data but multiple GetKafka Processors can be used to pull
            from multiple Topics, as each Processor will receive a different Processor UUID 
            and therefore a different Consumer Group Identifier.

                Apache NiFi is a framework to support highly scalable and flexible dataflows.
                It can be run on on laptops up through clusters of enterprise class servers.
                Instead of dictating a particular dataflow or behavior it empowers you to design your own
                optimal dataflow tailored to your specific environment.
